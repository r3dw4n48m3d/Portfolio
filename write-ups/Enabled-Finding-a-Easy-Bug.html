          <h3 class="article-section-title">Introduction</h3>
          <p class="article-content">
            Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Hope you all are
            doing well. In this writeup, I will be sharing my approach to stay
            updated with the latest Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. So
            let's begin.
          </p>

          <h3 class="article-section-title">
            What is the CVE or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures??
          </h3>
          <p class="article-content">
            Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a standardized system
            designed to identify and categorize publicly known vulnerabilities
            in software and hardware. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique
            identifier, known as a CVE ID, which follows the format
            "CVE-Year-Number" (e.g., CVE-2023-12345). This system is managed by
            the MITRE Corporation and is widely recognized across the
            cybersecurity industry. The purpose of CVE is to provide a common
            reference for discussing and addressing security flaws, enabling
            organizations, researchers, and security professionals to
            collaborate more effectively in mitigating risks. While CVE focuses
            on identification, it works in conjunction with systems like the
            Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which rates the severity
            of these vulnerabilities. By providing a unified way to reference
            security issues, CVE ensures consistency and helps streamline the
            vulnerability management process.
          </p>
          <h3 class="article-section-title">What is the use of CVE??</h3>
          <p class="article-content">
            The use of CVE lies in its role as a standardized system for
            identifying and categorizing vulnerabilities in software and
            hardware, making it a critical tool in cybersecurity. Here are the
            primary uses:
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            <b>1. Vulnerability Identification:</b> CVE provides a unique
            identifier for each publicly known vulnerability, allowing security
            professionals to reference specific issues consistently across
            different platforms, tools, and databases.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            <b>2. Improved Communication:</b> By standardizing vulnerability
            naming, CVE helps researchers, developers, and organizations
            communicate more effectively about specific security flaws, reducing
            confusion caused by different naming conventions.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            <b>3. Risk Prioritization:</b> Organizations can use CVE to identify
            vulnerabilities in their systems and prioritize remediation efforts
            based on the severity or criticality of the identified issues. This
            is often done in conjunction with CVSS scores.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            <b>4. Automation:</b> Many security tools and patch management
            systems use CVE identifiers to automate vulnerability detection and
            patching processes, helping organizations maintain secure
            environments without manual intervention.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            <b>5. Tracking and Reporting:</b> CVE allows organizations to track
            known vulnerabilities over time, facilitating reporting and
            monitoring for compliance, auditing, or risk management purposes.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content">
            By providing a common language for describing and addressing
            vulnerabilities, CVE enhances the efficiency of cybersecurity
            practices, improves communication, and supports proactive risk
            management across industries.
          </p>

            Now it't time fot the fun part and It's time to answer the questin
            <b>How I stay updated with CVEs?</b>
            For this task we are going to use the Shodan's CVE Database and some
            command line trick. Here is the command.
          </p>
          <!-- Code Section -->
          <div class="code-block">
            <p>curl https://cvedb.shodan.io/cves | jq | grep "cve_id"</p>
          </div>
          <!-- Image Section -->
          <div class="image-section">
            <div class="image-container">
              <img
                src="How-I-stay-updated-with-CVEs.png"
                alt="How-I-stay-updated-with-CVEs"
                class="fancy-image"
              />
              <p class="image-caption">Command and Result</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="article-content">
            <b>Wait!!!!!!!!!Wait!!!!!!!!!Wait</b>
            Dont' Go and Read full article. Because this part is more importent.
            Now that we know the command and saw the result let's break-down the
            command.
          </p>
          <h3 class="article-section-title">Breaking Down the command.</h3>
          <p class="article-content">The command</p>
          <div class="code-block">
            <p>curl https://cvedb.shodan.io/cves | jq | grep "cve_id"</p>
          </div>
          <p class="article-content">
            is designed to retrieve a list of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and
            Exposures) from a Shodan database, format the output, and filter for
            specific CVE IDs. Here’s a breakdown of each part:
          </p>
          <div class="code-block">
            <p>curl https://cvedb.shodan.io/cves :</p>
          </div>
          <p class="article-content">This part uses the</p>
          <div class="code-block">
            <p>curl</p>
          </div>
          <p class="article-content">
            command to make an HTTP request to the URL
          </p>
          <div class="code-block">
            <p>https://cvedb.shodan.io/cves</p>
          </div>
          <p class="article-content">
            which likely returns a list of CVEs in JSON format. curl retrieves
            the raw data from the Shodan CVE database.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block">
            <p>| jq :</p>
          </div>
          <p class="article-content">
            The pipe <i>(|)</i>takes the output from the <i>curl</i> command and
            passes it to <i>jq</i>, which is a command-line tool for processing
            JSON data. This will pretty-print the JSON output, making it easier
            to read and work with.
          </p>
          <div class="code-block">
            <p>| grep "cve_id"</p>
          </div>
          <p class="article-content">
            The final part of the command pipes the formatted JSON output to
            <i>grep</i>, a command used to search for specific strings in the
            input. In this case, it searches for any lines containing the string
            <i>"cve_id"</i>, which is the field where CVE identifiers are
            stored.
          </p>
          <h3 class="article-section-title">Overall Function:</h3>
          <p class="article-content">
            This command fetches the latest CVE data from Shodan, formats it
            into readable JSON, and then extracts only the lines that include
            CVE IDs, allowing you to see a list of the vulnerabilities by their
            unique identifiers.
          </p>
